# PokemonTales Master

## Global Overview

This repository is for my personal work-in-progress project of a game called PokeTales.
The project is to develop a Pokemon-like game, with an isometric open world, and battles in a board game style.
For the moment, I focused on the board battle, and mainly in 3D.
\
This repository is organised as a VS2022 project with two solutions : one for the 3D and the other for the 2D

## 3D Game

Most recent branch : **3DGameEngine_0.2**
\
This solution is the main core of the project with the more advanced part. It includes a tiny object-oriented graphics engine developed by myself with OpenGL. This engine is the base of all my project 3D and 2D renderings, and was a way for me to learn more about 3D rendering and graphics pipeline.
\
The goal is to have a standalone board game with two teams of Pokemon figthing each other, currently PvP and in the futur PvE. Currently, the "game" is not really playable, but is on the way of beeing.

## (2D Game)

Most recent branch : **GameSystem_Version1.1**
\
This solution is a draft, for testing several type of gameplay, on a 2D-board. 2D renderings are handled by 2D-graphics library SFML.
