# PokemonTales 3D

## Overview

This branch contains the more advanced core code of the project. The goal is to develop a standalone 3D board battle between two Pokemon teams, in PvP, and in the future in PvE. The game features all the basic Pokemon game gameplay and adapts them to a 4v4 battle on a board.
\
\
All the rendering are performed by a tiny object-oriented graphic engine I developed while I was learning about 3D rendering and graphics pipeline. I chose to start with the OpenGL API.
\
\
For me the goal of this project is twofold : 1. Develop a game idea I had 2. Train and improve myself in 3D rendering and graphic pipeline.
\
\
The project is in development, the visual aspect is very simple and the game isn't yet playable.
\
\
I also tried to learn about 3D modelisation, with a first 3D mesh with Blender, see BlenderProject folder

## Screens
